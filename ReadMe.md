# OmSaiClinic

OmSaiClinics is a personal doctor's appointment booking website. A freelancing project that I have completed on my own - including frontend, backend, databases, and hosting services.

Url: [OmSaiClinics](https://omsaiclinics.in/)

It consists of following sections:

- Header/Slider: Consist of a mini description, its mission, and vision
- Appointment form: A form for users/patients to book appointments.
- About Us: Description of doctor's studies and expertise.
- Honours & Awards: Awards and certifications earned
- Testimonials: Patient's testimonials or reviews
- Footer: Address, and contact information

It also has an admin panel to log in and review all booked appointments.
The appointments are classified or ordered based on dates i.e. Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow, and All.
